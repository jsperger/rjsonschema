# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

In the R ecosystem, there's a need for reliable and performant JSON schema validation. JSON is a widely used data interchange format, and JSON schemas provide a way to define the structure and constraints of JSON data. This package aims to fill the gap by offering a robust solution for R users who work with JSON data.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Data Integrity:** Ensures that JSON data conforms to a predefined structure and set of rules, preventing errors caused by malformed or unexpected data.
*   **Interoperability:** Facilitates data exchange between different systems by providing a common way to validate JSON structures.
*   **Development Efficiency:** Allows developers to catch data validation errors early in the development process, reducing debugging time.
*   **Performance:** By leveraging Rust for the core validation logic, the package aims to provide better performance compared to pure R implementations, especially for large JSON documents or complex schemas.

## How It Should Work

Users should be able to:

1.  Provide a JSON string or R object representing the data to be validated.
2.  Provide a JSON string or R object representing the JSON schema.
3.  Call an R function (e.g., `validate()`) that returns a boolean indicating whether the data is valid against the schema.
4.  Optionally, receive detailed error messages if the validation fails, pinpointing where the data does not conform to the schema.
5.  Specify the JSON schema draft version to be used for validation if necessary.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Ease of Use:** The R interface should be intuitive and straightforward for R users, following common R idioms.
*   **Clear Error Reporting:** Validation errors should be informative and help users quickly identify issues in their JSON data or schemas.
*   **Good Performance:** Validation should be fast enough for practical use cases, even with large inputs.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear documentation and examples should be provided to help users get started quickly.
*   **Reliability:** The package should be robust and produce consistent validation results.
