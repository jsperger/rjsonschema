# Project Brief

This project is an R package named `rjsonschema`. Its primary purpose is to provide JSON schema validation capabilities within the R environment.

## Core Requirements and Goals

*   Validate JSON data against a given JSON schema.
*   Support multiple JSON schema draft versions.
*   Integrate Rust for performance-critical validation logic.
*   Provide a user-friendly R interface to the validation functions.
*   Ensure the package is well-documented and easy to use for R developers.
*   Maintain compatibility with CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) policies.

## Scope

The project focuses on providing robust and efficient JSON schema validation. It includes:

*   R functions for users to perform validation.
*   Underlying Rust implementation for the core validation logic.
*   Support for different JSON schema specification versions.
*   Unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
*   Documentation for users and developers.
*   Build and configuration files for R package development.
