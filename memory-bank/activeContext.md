# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on initial repository exploration and setting up the Memory Bank. The goal is to understand the project's structure, technologies, and overall purpose.

## Recent Changes

*   `AGENTS.md` created.
*   Initial Memory Bank files created:
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `activeContext.md` (this file)
    *   `progress.md`

## Next Steps

*   Complete the initial overview of the repository.
*   Wait for a specific task or issue to address.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   The Memory Bank structure defined in `AGENTS.md` is being followed.
*   Information for the Memory Bank is being gathered by inspecting repository files.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Maintain detailed and accurate Memory Bank files, as per `AGENTS.md`.
*   Explore files systematically to build context.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The project is an R package (`rjsonschema`) using Rust for JSON schema validation via the `jsonschema` crate and `extendr`.
*   Key files for understanding the Rust integration are `src/rust/Cargo.toml`, `R/extendr-wrappers.R`, and the `Makevars` / `configure` files.
*   The package aims to support multiple JSON schema drafts.
